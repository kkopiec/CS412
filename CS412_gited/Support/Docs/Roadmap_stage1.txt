1. We need to be able to read the files
2. Files are xml formed (thats good) so we need to be able to parse xml
2.1 xml parsers are available for java ( in std libs i think)
3. we need to stem content using lucene and store result in some serializable object so we do not need to stem files again and again
4. we need some test plan and harness tests to be sure that the above works

Thats it for the first milestone DL 30th Oct
